Stock Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on stock-related data. The goal is to analyze the sentiment expressed in textual data related to stocks and predict the sentiment (positive or negative) associated with the text.

Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries to be installed:

wordcloud
gensim
nltk
numpy
pandas
seaborn
tensorflow
jupyterthemes
sklearn
You can install these libraries using the following command:

diff
Copy code
!pip install wordcloud gensim nltk numpy pandas seaborn tensorflow jupyterthemes sklearn
Usage
Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
Import the necessary libraries in your Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
Load the stock data using the provided CSV file.
Perform data cleaning, including removing punctuations and stopwords.
Visualize the dataset using plots and word clouds.
Prepare the data by tokenizing and padding it.
Build a custom-based deep neural network for sentiment analysis.
Train the model and evaluate its performance.
Assess the training model's performance by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC.
Visualize the confusion matrix.
